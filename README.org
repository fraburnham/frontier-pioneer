* Frontier Pioneer 2x

*Frontier Pioneer 2x* is a simultaneous, roll-and-write game with a fixed number of rounds where players explore procedurally generated space
sectors, scan for resources, and upgrade their ships. Players do not take turns; instead, they independently choose actions based on the
results of a shared dice pool. There are 30 rolls total for 30-60min of play time.

** Rules

*** Dice

A set of 6 polyhedral die are used for the shared pool.

Not each die is used for each action. Below is a list of actions that each die is used in.

- d4: Move / Map Sector / Resource Scan / Anomaly
  - Typically controls distance
- d6: Map Sector
  - Controls "Sector Type"
- d8: Resource Scan / Anomaly
  - Typically controls resource type
- d10: Map Sector / Resource Scan
  - Typically a count of resources
- d12: Resource Scan
- d20: Anomaly
  - Typically the amount of a resource that will be used.

*** The Board

TODO: link to printable board

**** Sector Map

The sector map is a bunch of squares that have 4 sections:

|---|---|
| A | B |
|---|---|
| C | D |
|---|---|

- A
  - Unused
- B
  - Sectory Type
- C
  - Resource Count
- D
  - Resource Type

At the beginning of the game there is no "map" defined. You can choose any arbitrary location and start in that sector.
    
**** Upgrades

Upgrades require 15 resources each to enable.

TODO: describe how to get upgrades based on board setup
TODO: decide how many resources before the upgrade is usable (maybe it should vary...)

- Blink Drive
  - 2x to moves
  - Usable resources
    - Dark Matter
    - Exotic Minerals
    - Water
- Terraforming Technology
  - Optionally use d20 for resources in star system sectors
  - Usable resources
    - Raw Metals
    - Metal Alloys
    - Water
- Ship Improvements
  - +2 to resources
  - -1 to damage
  - Usable resources
    - Silicon
    - Metal Alloys
    - Water
- Scanner Technology
  - Automatically map and resources when moving to a sector
  - Usable resources
    - Silicon
    - Exotic Minerals
    - Water

**** Damage

TODO: describe how to record damage

*** Actions

In each round, after the dice have been rolled, you choose an action then perform it using dice from the pool. If a natural 20 is rolled on the d20 then all
players are forced to take the Anomaly action.

**** Move

When you pass through a sector you can collect the resources in it.

- d4 (Warp Drive): Determines the maximum number of sectors a player can move.

**** Map Sector

You must discover a sector before you're able to scan it for resources. Choose one sector within the range determined by the scan range (d10) and mark it as
having the sector type (d6).

- d10 (Scan Intensity): Determines the maximum number of spaces away the scan will effect.
- d6 (Sector Type): Determines the type of sector that is discovered.
  1. Deep Space
  2. Colonized Star System
  3. Uncolonized Star System
  4. Nebula
     - Requires two movement points to exit
  5. Enemy Space
     - Suffer 2 damage to enter
     - Does not contain resources
  6. Deep Space

**** Resource Scan

Once a sector has been discovered it can be scanned for resources which can be collected by moving to that sector. You can scan the sector you're occupying.

- d10 (Scan Range): Determines how far the scan reaches.
- d8 (Resource Type): Determines the type of resource discovered.
  1. Nothing
  2. Water
     - Never in deep space
  3. Raw Metals
  4. Metal Alloys
  5. Silicon
  6. Dark Matter
     - Never in a colonized system
  7. Exotic Minerals
     - Never in a colonized system
  8. Nothing
- d12 (Resource Quantity): Determines the amount of the resource discovered.

**** Anomaly (forced action)

When a 20 is rolled all players are forced to take the Anomaly action.

- d4 (Anomaly Range): Determines the area of effect of the anomaly.
- d8 (Anomaly Type): Determines the nature of the anomaly.
  1. Space Rift
     - Forces movement (use d6)
  2. Energy Surge
     - Cuts mapping/scanning range -2
  3. Asteroid Shower
     - Causes ship damage (use d6)
  4. Gravitational Distortion
     - Destroy resources in two sectors in d4 range
  5. Temporal Distortion
     - Double cost of movment on next turn
  6. Alien Signal
     - Causes mapping/scanning to fail next turn
  7. Alien encounter
     - Causes ship damage (use d6)
  8. Space pirates
     - Takes all resources from mapped sectors up to d6 sectors within d4 range

*** Mesuring Range

TODO: range is only ever measured by lines that would be valid for movement. No diagonals.

*** Scoring

TODO: This will need to be a mix of resources, upgrades, explored sectors
For now 1 pt each
- Mapped sector
- Resource collected

10 pts each upgrade

-1 pt each damage
